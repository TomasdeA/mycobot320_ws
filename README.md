This ROS 2 package provides symbolic and numeric tools to analyze the kinematics and singularities of the myCobot320 robot. It combines the flexibility of the Python Robotics Toolbox with ROS 2 tools like RViz with joint state publishing.

---

## Features

- Forward and inverse kinematics (symbolic + numeric)
- Jacobian and singularity analysis
- Nullspace trajectory generation
- Visualization via RViz (`joint_state_publisher`)
- Integration-ready with MoveIt for collision checking

---

## Setup installation

### 1. Install ROS and dependencies

Make sure ROS2 (Humble) is installed and sourced.

Install system dependencies:

```bash
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y
```
`rosdep` scans the `.xml` files to determine which dependencies need to be installed from apt.

### 2. Install Python requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
These dependencies come from PyPI (e.g., roboticstoolbox-python) are not resolvable via rosdep.

## 3. Build the Workspace 
```bash
cd ~/mycobot320_ws 
colcon build 
source ~/mycobot320_ws/install/setup.bash
```
## Launch commands

### URDF Visualization with Sliders

```bash
ros2 launch mycobot320_description display.launch.py
```

### Show All 8 Configurations for a Single Pose

```bash
ros2 launch mycobot320_analysis show_configurations.launch.py
```

### Singularity Analysis

#### Shoulder
```bash
ros2 launch mycobot320_analysis analyze_singularity_shoulder.launch.py
```

#### Elbow
```bash
ros2 launch mycobot320_analysis analyze_singularity_elbow.launch.py
```

#### Wrist
```bash
ros2 launch mycobot320_analysis analyze_singularity_wrist.launch.py
```

### CLI Menu (Optional)

To perform a complete analysis from an interactive menu:

```bash
./run_analysis_menu.py 
```
